## Join the Embodied Computation Group

We are always looking for talented and passionate individuals who want to push the boundaries of embodied cognition, computational neuroscience, and brain-body interaction research. Our lab thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative thinking.

### Current Openings

We welcome applications from exceptional candidates at all levels. While specific funded positions vary, we are particularly interested in hearing from candidates with:

- **Strong computational background** - Experience in computational modelling, machine learning, statistics, or applied mathematics
- **Neuroscience expertise** - Understanding of neural systems, particularly interoception, decision-making, and consciousness
- **Neuroimaging experience** - Skills in fMRI analysis, particularly advanced or high-field imaging
- **Interdisciplinary mindset** - Ability to bridge computational, experimental, and clinical approaches

### PhD Students

**PhD Programs:** Prospective PhD students should apply through Aarhus University's graduate programs in:
- Neuroscience
- Clinical Medicine
- Cognitive Science

**What we offer:**
- Training in computational modelling, psychophysics, and neuroimaging
- Access to state-of-the-art imaging facilities
- Collaboration with international researchers
- Mentorship focused on both research excellence and career development
- A supportive and collaborative lab environment

### Postdoctoral Researchers

We seek postdocs who can drive independent research while contributing to our collaborative environment. Ideal candidates will have:
- PhD in neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, computer science, or related field
- Strong publication record demonstrating innovative thinking
- Computational skills (Python/MATLAB/R, computational modelling, data analysis)
- Interest in interoception, embodied cognition, brain-body interaction, or related topics

**Funding opportunities:**
- Lab-funded positions (when available)
- Support for fellowship applications (e.g., Marie Curie, Lundbeck Foundation, etc.)

### Visiting Scholars

We welcome visiting students and scholars who can contribute to ongoing projects. Visits typically range from 3-12 months. Visitors should:
- Have their own funding or apply for visitor fellowships
- Propose a specific project aligned with lab interests
- Bring complementary expertise that enriches the lab

### How to Apply

**For all positions:**

1. **Email Dr. Micah Allen** at micah@cfin.au.dk with:
   - CV including publications and presentations
   - Brief statement (1-2 pages) describing:
     - Your research interests and background
     - Why you want to join the Embodied Computation Group
     - Your career goals
   - Names and contact information for 2-3 references
   - For postdocs: 1-2 representative publications

2. **Subject line format:** "[Position Type] Application - [Your Name]"

3. **Timeline:** We review applications on a rolling basis. For PhD students, follow program-specific deadlines.

### What Makes a Strong Candidate

Beyond technical skills, we value:
- **Intellectual curiosity** - Willingness to explore challenging questions
- **Collaborative spirit** - Ability to work in interdisciplinary teams
- **Open science commitment** - Enthusiasm for sharing code, data, and knowledge
- **Growth mindset** - Eagerness to learn new methods and approaches
- **Communication skills** - Ability to explain complex ideas clearly

### Life in the Lab

**Culture:**
- Collaborative, supportive atmosphere

- Strong emphasis on work-life balance
- Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion

**Location:**
- Based at Aarhus University, Denmark
- Part of the Department of Clinical Medicine
- Strong connections to Cambridge Psychiatry

**Resources:**
- Access to high-field MRI facilities
- Computational resources for modelling and analysis
- Funding for conferences and training
- International collaboration network

### Diversity Statement

The Embodied Computation Group is committed to building a diverse and inclusive research environment. We strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, particularly those from groups historically underrepresented in neuroscience. We believe diverse perspectives strengthen science and actively work to create an environment where everyone can thrive.
