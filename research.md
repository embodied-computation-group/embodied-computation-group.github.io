### Research Overview

The Embodied Computation Group investigates how visceral and embodied processes shape our decision-making, emotion, and conscious perception. Our research program combines computational modelling, psychophysics, physiological measures, and advanced neuroimaging.

### Visceral Inference & Interoception

How does the brain process signals from within the body? We study the computational and neural mechanisms underlying interoception - the sense of the internal state of the body. Our work examines how cardiac, respiratory, and gastric signals influence perception, attention, and decision-making.

### Computational Models of Brain-Body Interaction

We develop and test computational models that formalize how the brain integrates bodily signals with external sensory information. Drawing on predictive processing and active inference frameworks, we aim to understand the computational principles governing embodied cognition.

### Emotion & Affect

Emotions are fundamentally embodied experiences. We investigate how bodily states contribute to emotional experience and how disruptions in brain-body interaction may contribute to affective disorders such as anxiety and depression.

---

### Consciousness & Perception

How do bodily signals influence conscious awareness? Our work explores the relationship between interoceptive processing and conscious perception, including how cardiac and respiratory cycles modulate what we see and experience.

---

### Clinical Applications

We translate our basic research findings to understand clinical populations suffering from disordered brain-body interaction. This includes work on anxiety disorders, depression, and other conditions characterized by altered interoceptive processing.

### Methods

Our research employs a diverse methodological toolkit:

- **Computational Modelling**: Bayesian inference, predictive coding, reinforcement learning
- **Neuroimaging**: fMRI, including laminar and ultra-high field imaging
- **Psychophysics**: Signal detection theory, threshold measurement, metacognition
- **Physiology**: ECG, respiration, pupillometry, skin conductance
