Welcome to the new website of the Embodied Computation Group!

We are a multidisciplinary research lab located at Aarhus University and Cambridge Psychiatry, led by Dr Micah Allen. Our research investigates how our decision-making, emotion, and conscious perception are shaped by visceral and embodied processes.

## Our Research

To probe the embodied brain, we use tools like:
- Computational modelling
- Psychophysics
- Physiological measures
- Advanced neuroimaging

Our work comprises both basic research into the neural mechanisms underpinning visceral inference, and clinical research seeking to apply these mechanisms to better understand populations suffering from disordered brain-body interaction and mental illness.
