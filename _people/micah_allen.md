Dr. Micah Allen leads the Embodied Computation Group, investigating how visceral and embodied processes shape our decision-making, emotion, and conscious perception. His research combines computational modelling, psychophysics, physiological measures, and advanced neuroimaging to probe the embodied brain.

The lab's work spans basic research into the neural mechanisms underpinning visceral inference, and clinical research seeking to apply these mechanisms to better understand populations suffering from disordered brain-body interaction and mental illness.
