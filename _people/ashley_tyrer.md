- _Postdoctoral Fellow_<br>

Dr. Tyrer completed the Wellcome Trust PhD Programme in Neural Dynamics at the University of Bristol, where she worked together with Prof. Rosalyn Moran on active inference models of learning, decision-making, and noradrenaline. As a postdoctoral fellow in the ECG, Dr Tyrer is utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms underpinning the control of learning and interoception by central and peripheral noradrenaline.
