I am a cognitive neuroscientist fascinated by how we come to have conscious experiences in this world. My research aims to bridge sensory/bodily and cognitive levels of analysis to uncover the neural and cognitive underpinnings of conscious contents. I'm interested in cortical signalling linked to conscious perception and altered conscious percepts in states such as chronic pain, hypnosis, or psychedelics. I envision that insights from consciousness science can be applied to assist the rehabilitation of clinical populations.
