Dr. Nikolova is interested in how we experience the environment depending on our internal conditions. As a postdoc in the Embodied Computation Group, she designs psychophysical tasks and work on fMRI analyses to examine the internal processes of perceptual learning and decision making. Before coming to Aarhus, she worked with William McGeown (University of Strathclyde) on a multimodal project investigating hypnotic suggestibility, as well as with Lars Muckli (University of Glasgow) to look at illusory perception and binocular rivalry. In 2018, she completed her PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research & City University of London with the supervision of Michael Morgan and Josh Solomon, during which she examined how we perceive radial movement, using the motion aftereffect. Aside from research, she is involved in science outreach in schools, she plays the flute, and makes various electronic projects.
