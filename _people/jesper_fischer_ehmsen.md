Jesper Fischer Ehmsen's research focuses on pain, thermosensation, learning, and Bayesian modeling. His work investigates how the brain processes thermal sensations and pain through predictive coding frameworks, including studies on the thermal grill illusion. During his time in the ECG, he also contributed to research on interoception, examining respiratory and cardiac sensitivity across populations.
