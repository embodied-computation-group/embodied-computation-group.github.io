### About Us

The Embodied Computation Group (ECG) is a multidisciplinary research lab located at Aarhus University and Cambridge Psychiatry, led by Dr Micah Allen. We investigate how our decision-making, emotion, and conscious perception are shaped by visceral and embodied processes.

Our team brings together expertise in computational modelling, psychophysics, physiological measurement, and advanced neuroimaging to probe the embodied brain. We are committed to open science practices and collaborative research.

### Our Approach

We combine cutting-edge methods to understand brain-body interaction:

- **Computational Modelling**: Developing and testing models of visceral inference and interoceptive processing
- **Psychophysics**: Designing behavioral experiments to probe conscious perception and decision-making
- **Neuroimaging**: Using fMRI and other advanced imaging techniques to map neural mechanisms
- **Physiological Measures**: Recording cardiac, respiratory, and other bodily signals to understand their influence on cognition

### Research Themes

Our work spans two interconnected domains:

**Basic Research**: We investigate the neural mechanisms underpinning visceral inference - how the brain processes and integrates signals from the body to shape perception, emotion, and decision-making.

**Clinical Research**: We apply our understanding of brain-body interaction to better understand populations suffering from disordered interoception and mental illness, with the goal of developing new interventions.
